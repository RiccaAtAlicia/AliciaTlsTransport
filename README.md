Alicia Tls Transport is a tunnel app that obfs itself into a normal tls connection(other obfss are coming).
Unlike SSR's SSL obfs,ATTr will use a cert and a domain.In order to make it more difficult to be found,we even share port 443 with normal webserver. Those who access your server without proper key will get a normal page ( or a 403 for not existing pages)
